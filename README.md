# Instagram Clone

Instagram schema based on Colt Steele's Udemy Course.
Learned how to create a schema connecting Users to liks to tags and photo tags. 

And then ran basic queries on a sample data set loaded into the database. 

Files in this Folder:
schema.sql -> Contains the Instagram clone schema
user_data.sql-> Contains the sample user data to load into the tables of the database
ig_queries -> Contains the various queries based on user stats.
